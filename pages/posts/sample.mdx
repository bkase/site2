# Fast Accumulation on Streams

While developing Coda, we came across an interesting problem that uncovered a much more general and potentially widely applicable problem: Taking advantage of parallelism when combining a large amount of data streaming in over time. We were able to come up with a solution that scales up to any throughput optimally while simultaneously minimizing latency and space usage. We’re sharing our results with the hope that others dealing with manipulation of online data streams will find them interesting and applicable.

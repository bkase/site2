# Introducing Barbq

TUIs[^1] for life. [Barbq](https://github.com/bkase/barbq) üçñ is a TUI-based status-bar for macOS.

Barbq is a simple, no frills, terminal-based status bar. I host it in an instance of alacritty terminal[^2] which I pin to the top of the screen using the yabai tiling window manager.

![my environment](/static/posts/introducing-barbq/motivation.png)

To be clear: The above is not a Linux system. I am running macOS 10.15. You're just seeing the wonderful kitty terminals, yabai window manager, and barbq status bar inside alacritty.

## Features

* Widgets for yabai tabs, internal/external ip addrs, volume, battery, wifi, date
* Volume info grabbed via low-level C executable to avoid overhead of invoking osascript
* Resource efficient[^3]
* Modular and extensible[^4]
* Stable enough that this author has been using barbq 100% of the time for over a month

## Future work

* Support other data sourcing methods in addition to interval-based polling[^5]
* Cleaner and more usable layout methods for views
* More refined UI work regarding, colors, positiong, margins, and unicode decorations

## Installation

For up-to-date installation instructions [visit the GitHub project](https://github.com/bkase/barbq).

## Under the hood

Barbq is written in Haskell. And is this author's first "real" Haskell project.

Since this is a side-project, long-cuts[^6] were made in order to do things in an interesting manner. Look for future blog posts on the two interesting pieces here: (1) Using free applicative functors for creating model data to feed views and (2) building terminal-UI components in UI-paradigm-agnostic comonadic style.

I welcome all code reviews! If you have any experience with Haskell, I'd appreciate feedback on my code. Please open an issue in the project to let me know!

[^1]: Terminal User Interface
[^2]: Alacritty is installed for you as a dependency when you build with Nix.
[^3]: ~0.5% of CPU on my machine.
[^4]: Through the editing of Haskell code.
[^5]: Interrupts via HTTP server or mouse clicks for example.
[^6]: The opposite of a shortcut.

# Introducing Barbq

There are no TUI[^1]-aesthtic status-bar replacements for macOS. So I made one: [Barbq](https://github.com/bkase/barbq)!

![barbq status bar](/static/posts/introducing-barbq/barbq.png)

Barbq is a simple, no frills, terminal-based status bar. I host it in an instance of Alacritty terminal[^2] which I pin to the top of the screen using the Yabai tiling window manager.

## Features

* Widgets for yabai tabs, internal/external ip addrs, volume, battery, wifi, date
* Volume info grabbed via low-level C executable to avoid overhead of invoking osascript
* Resource efficient[^3]
* Modular and extensible[^4]

## Future work

* Support other data sourcing methods in addition to interval-based polling[^5]
* Cleaner and more usable layout methods for views
* More refined UI work regarding, colors, positiong, margins, and unicode decorations

## Installation

For up-to-date installation instructions visit the GitHub project.

(TODO, add this to Github docs
Prerequisites:
  * You're using the yabai tiling window manager on your system
  * You're using a font with PragmataPro-style glyphs (afaik this means the PragmataPro font)
  * Nix package manager is installed
)

## Under the hood

Barbq is written in Haskell. And is this author's first "real" Haskell project.

Since this is a side-project, long-cuts[^6] were made in order to do things in an interesting manner. Look for future blog posts on the two interesting pieces here: (1) Using free applicative functors for creating model data to feed views and (2) building terminal-UI components in UI-paradigm-agnostic comonadic style.

I welcome all code reviews! If you have any experience with Haskell, I'd appreciate feedback on my code. Please open an issue in the project to let me know!

[^1]: Terminal User Interface.
[^2]: Alacritty is installed for you as a dependency when you build with Nix.
[^3]: ~0.5% of CPU on my machine.
[^4]: Through the editing of Haskell code.
[^5]: Interrupts via HTTP server or mouse clicks for example.
[^6]: The opposite of a shortcut.

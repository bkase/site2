# Reducers are Monoids on Functions

Reducers &mdash; a tool for handling state changes &mdash; help engineers manage complexity in their applications. In this post, we'll dig into how these reducers tick by exploring some monoids on functions, learning some formal terms, and discovering the underlying reason that many engineers reach for reducers to simplify mutations of state. All code examples will be presented in OCaml, ReasonML, TypeScript, Haskell, and Swift.

## Preliminaries

I expect readers to be familiar with the material covered in the [first post on semigroups and monoids](/posts/semigroups-and-monoids), but to keep this post more or less self-contained I'll review the declaration of semigroups and monoids here:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ocaml
module type Semigroup = sig
  type t

  (* We don't use <> in the ML langs because <> is traditionally "is not equal" *)
  val (+) : t -> t -> t
end

module type Monoid = sig
  include Semigroup
  val empty : t
end
```

```typescript
interface Semigroup<A> {
  concat: (x: A, y: A) => A
}

interface Monoid<A> extends Semigroup<A> {
  readonly empty: A
}
```

```haskell
class Semigroup a where
  (<>) :: a -> a -> a

class Semigroup a => Monoid a where
  mempty :: a
```

```swift
protocol Semigroup {
  static func <>(a: Self, b: Self) -> Self
}

protocol Monoid : Semigroup {
  static var empty : Self { get }
}
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

## Endofunctions are monoids

Endofunctions, or in source code, `Endo`,  are functions from some type to itself[^1]; for example `int -> int` or `Person -> Person`. Endofunctions come up in everyday programming as a mechanism for somewhat paradoxicly describing mutations to data immutably. In other words, we can reify[^2] mutations into values.

To see this, let's first implement endofunctions:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ocaml
module Endo (A: sig type t end) = struct
  type t = A.t -> A.t
end
```

```typescript
interface Endo<A> {
    (x: A): A
}
```

```haskell
newtype Endo a = Endo (a -> a)
```

```swift
struct Endo<A> { let f: @escaping (A) -> A }
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

And then consider a `Person` object/record/struct

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ocaml
module Person = struct
  type t =
    { name: string
    ; age: int
    }
end
```

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string
  age: number
}
```

```haskell
data Person = Person
  { name: String
  , age: Int
  }
```

```swift
struct Person {
  var name: String
  var age: Int
}
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

A person, Fred, can age one year like so:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ocaml
module PersonEndo = Endo(struct type t = Person.t end)
let oneYearOlder : PersonEndo.t = fun p -> { p with age = p.age + 1 }

let agedFred =
  let fred = { Person.name = "Fred"; age = 20 } in
  let fred' = oneYearOlder fred in
  fred' (* { name = "Fred", age = 21 } *)
```

```typescript
const oneYearOlder: Endo<Person> = p => ({ ...p, age: p.age + 1 });

const agedFred = () => {
    const fred = { name: "Fred", age: 20 };
    const fred_ = oneYearOlder(fred);
    return fred_ /* { name: "Fred", age: 21 } */
}
```

```haskell
oneYearOlder :: Endo Person
oneYearOlder = Endo $ \p -> p { age = age p + 1 }

agedFred :: Person
agedFred =
  let fred = { name = "Fred", age = 20 } in
  let fred' = oneYearOlder fred in
  fred' (* { name = "Fred", age = 21 } *)
```

```swift
// it looks like we're mutating here, but due to value semantics of
// structs in Swift, this is fine
let oneYearOlder: Endo<Person> =
  Endo { p in p.age = p.age+1; return p }

let agedFred = { () in
  let fred = Person(name: "Fred", age: 20)
  let fred_ = oneYearOlder.run(fred)
  return fred_ /* Person(name: "Fred", age: 21) */
}
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

Notice a few interesting facts here:

1. `oneYearOlder`, the change, is a value that we can store, manipulate, and do with what we choose.
2. We were able to change `fred` despite `fred` being an immutable value in our language. To do this we can introduce a new value with the changes applied.

### The Semigroup

The semigroup instance on endofunctions gives us a way to combine two changes into a single change. Concretely, we may want to also change our name field to add a last name, for example, we want to `addLastNameSmith`:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ocaml
let oneYearOlder : PersonEndo.t = fun p -> { p with age = p.age + 1 }
let addLastNameSmith : PersonEndo.t = fun p -> { p with name = p.name ^ " Smith" }

let agedFred =
  let fred = { Person.name = "Fred", age = 20 } in
  let change = PersonEndo.(oneYearOlder + addLastNameSmith) in
  let fred' = change fred in
  fred' (* { name = "Fred Smith", age = 21 } *)
```

```typescript
const oneYearOlder: Endo<Person> = p => ({ ...p, age: p.age + 1 });
const addLastNameSmith: Endo<Person> = p => ({ ...p, name: p.name + " Smith" });

const agedFred = () => {
    const fred = { name: "Fred", age: 20 };
    const change = endoMonoid<Person>().concat(
        oneYearOlder,
        addLastNameSmith
    );
    const fred_ = change(fred);
    return fred_ /* { name: "Fred Smith", age: 21 } */
}
```

```haskell
oneYearOlder :: Endo Person
oneYearOlder = Endo $ \p -> p { age = age p + 1 }

addLastNameSmith :: Endo Person
addLastNameSmith = Endo $ \p -> p { name = name p <> " Smith" }

agedFred :: Person
agedFred =
  let fred = { name = "Fred", age = 20 } in
  let change = oneYearOlder <> addLastNameSmith in
  let fred' = change fred in
  fred' (* { name = "Fred Smith", age = 21 } *)
```

```swift
let oneYearOlder: Endo<Person> =
  Endo { p in p.age = p.age+1; return p }

let addLastNameSmith: Endo<Person> =
  Endo { p in p.name = p.name + " Smith"; return p }

let agedFred = { () in
  let fred = Person(name: "Fred", age: 20)
  let change = oneYearOlder <> addLastNameSmith
  let fred_ = change.run(fred)
  return fred_ /* Person(name: "Fred Smith", age: 21) */
}
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

### The Monoid

The monoid instance provides a way to model a trivial change[^3]. With this addition, we now have a nice base case if we're building up an arbitrary amount of changes based on some runtime information:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ocaml
let change = PersonEndo.empty in
(* ... *)
let change =
  change +
  (if aYearPasses then
    oneYearOlder
   else
    PersonEndo.empty)
in
()
(* etc *)
```

```typescript
var change = endoMonoid<Person>.empty in
// ...
change =
  endoMonoid<Person>.concat(
    change,
    aYearPasses ? oneYearOlder : endoMonoid<Person>.empty
  );
// etc
```

```haskell
let change = mempty in
-- ...
let change =
  change <>
    (if aYearPasses then
      oneYearOlder
     else
      mempty)
in
-- etc
```

```swift
var change = Endo<Person>.empty
// ...
change =
  change <>
    (aYearPasses ? oneYearOlder : Endo<Person>.empty)
// etc
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

We can further improve on the above by utilizing a [writer monad as described in an older post](/posts/ocaml-writer) to remove all of the boilerplate doing something like the above.

### The Instance

An astute reader may notice "combining changes" is function composition or $\circ$, and the trivial change is the identity function or $id$. Thus the monoid we've been talking about this whole time is $(Endo_A, \circ, id_A)$[^4].

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ocaml
module Endo (A: sig type t end) = struct
  type t = A.t -> A.t

  let (+) f g = fun a -> f (g a)

  let empty = ident
end
```

```typescript
const endoMonoid: <A>() => Monoid<Endo<A>> = () => ({
    concat: (f, g) => x => g(f(x)),
    empty: x => x
});
```

```haskell
-- This is defined in Data.Monoid.Endo
instance Semigroup (Endo a) where
  (Endo f) <> (Endo g) = Endo $ f . g
instance Monoid (Endo a) where
  mempty = Endo id
```

```swift
extension Endo : Semigroup {
  static func <>(f: Endo, g: Endo) -> Endo {
    Endo { x in f(g(x)) }
  }
}
extension Endo : Monoid {
  static var empty { return Endo { x in x } }
}
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

## Pointwise operations over monoids are monoids

A _pointwise operation_ is some operation $\oplus$ on some type $T$ that is "lifted" to act on functions that return $T$. More formally, $\forall f,g. (f \oplus g)(x) = x \rightarrow f(x) \oplus g(x)$. If code is your thing, what follows is the function that lifts a binary operation pointwise:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ocaml
(* val liftPointwise :
    (       'a  ->        'a ->         'a) ->
    (('x -> 'a) -> ('x -> 'a) -> ('x -> 'a)) *)
let liftPointwise op = fun f1 f2 -> fun x ->
  op (f1 x) (f2 x)
```

```typescript
const liftPointwise_:
    <X, A>(op: ( x: A,            y: A)     => A) =>
               (f1: (x: X) => A, f2: (x: X) => A) =>
               (x: X) => A =
        op => (f1, f2) => x => op(f1(x), f2(x))
```

```haskell
liftPointwise ::
  (      a  ->       a  ->       a) ->
  ((x -> a) -> (x -> a) -> (x -> a)
liftPointwise op = \f1 f2 -> \x ->
  op (f1 x) (f2 x)
```

```swift
func liftPointwise<X, A>(
  op: @escaping (A,                  A)       -> A
) -> (@escaping (X) -> A, @escaping (X) -> A) -> (X) -> A {
    return { f1, f2 in { x in op(f1(x), f2(x)) } }
}
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

An interesting property of pointwise operations is that if the underlying operation is a monoid[^5] than the resulting pointwise operation is a monoid too! I think a nice proof of this is to show the source code that performs this operation for us.

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ocaml
module LiftPointwise(M: Monoid) = struct
  type 'x t = 'x -> M.t

  let (+) f1 f2 = fun x -> M.((f1 x) + (f2 x))

  let empty = fun _x -> M.empty
end
```

```typescript
interface Func<X, A> {
    (x: X): A
}

const liftPointwise: <X, A>(m: Monoid<A>) => Monoid<Func<X, A>> = m => ({
    concat: (f1, f2) => x => m.concat(f1(x), f2(x)),
    empty: _x => m.empty
})
```

```haskell
-- This is defined in Data.Semigroup
instance Semigroup a => Semigroup (x -> a) where
  (<>) f1 f2 = \x -> (f1 x) <> (f2 x)
-- This is defined in Data.Monoid
instance Monoid a => Monoid (x -> a) where
  mempty = \_x -> mempty
```

```swift
struct Func<X, A> {
  let run: (X) -> A
}

extension Func: Semigroup where A: Semigroup {
  static func <>(f1: Func<X, A>, f2: Func<X, A>) -> Func<X, A> {
    Func { x in
      f1.run(x) <> f2.run(x)
    }
  }
}

extension Func: Monoid where A: Monoid {
  static var empty: Func<X, A> {
    return Func<X, A> { _x in A.empty }
  }
}
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

Sometimes you want to manipulate functions over the operations rather than the underlying operations themselves. The nice thing is we don't have to give up our monoidal superpowers when we do so!

## Reducers

Manipulation of state in large applications quickly gets hairy. As an application grows, it becomes a real challenge to be sure that state mutations affect only the components you want it to. One mitigation is to centralize all of your state manipulation as best as you can &mdash; ideally to one function or one file or one module. To do so, we can decouple an intention to change state (or an action) from the actual state change itself.

Reducers are one way to cleanly declare atomic chunks of state manipulation in response to these actions. Smaller reducers can be composed into bigger ones as our application's state management grows in scope.

Let's take [Redux](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers/) reducers as an example to explore further. According to the [official documentation](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers/), a reducer is defined by a function from the previous state and an action into a new state $(S, A) \rightarrow S$. In theory, we would feed some library a bunch of these reducers and in our application we could fire actions to trigger these state changes. In code, this definition of a reducer looks as follows:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ocaml
let reducer : 'state * 'action -> 'state = ()
```

```typescript
const reducer: <S,A>(state: S, action: A) => S
```

```haskell
reducer :: (state, action) -> state
```

```swift
func reducer<S,A>(state: S, action: A) -> S
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

In Redux, reducers can be combined with a `combineReducers` function, but it's not immediately obvious exactly how this function would work.

## Reducers are monoids

Redux is great because it introduced the concept of reducers to the masses. But instead of using a library directly, let's re-arrange Redux's reducer function a bit to see if we can build the library ourselves.

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ocaml
let reducer : 'state * 'action -> 'state = ()
(* flip the tuple *)
let reducer : 'action * 'state -> 'state = ()
(* curry the function (unroll the tuple into a function) *)
let reducer : 'action -> 'state -> 'state = ()
(* rewrite ('state -> 'state) to StateEndo *)
let reducer : 'action -> StateEndo.t = ()
(* reducer is a monoid because StateEndo is a
   monoid, and it's a pointwise function into
   a monoid. *)
```

```typescript
const reducer: <S,A>(state: S, action: A) => S
// flip the parameters
const reducer: <S,A>(action: A, state: S) => S
// curry the function (unroll the tupled parameters into a function)
const reducer: <S,A>(action: A) => (state: S) => S
// rewrite (state: S) => S into Endo<S>
const reducer: <S,A>(action: A) => Endo<S>
// wrap in Func
const reducer: <S,A>() => Func<A, Endo<S>>
// reducer() is a monoid because Endo<S> is a
// monoid, and it's a pointwise function int
// a monoid.
```

```haskell
reducer :: (state, action) -> state
-- flip the tuple
reducer :: (action, state) -> state
-- curry the function
reducer :: action -> state -> state
-- rewrite (state -> state) to (Endo state)
reducer :: action -> Endo state
-- reducer is a monoid because (Endo state) is a
-- monoid, and it's a pointwise function into
-- a monoid.
```

```swift
func reducer<S,A>(state: S, action: A) -> S
// flip the parameters
func reducer<S,A>(action: A, state: S) -> S
// curry the function
func reducer<S,A>(action: A) -> (S) -> S
// rewrite (S -> S) to Endo<S>
func reducer<S,A>(action: A) -> Endo<S>
// wrap in Func
func reducer<S,A>() -> Func<A, Endo<S>>
// reducer is a monoid because Endo<S> is a
// monoid, and it's a pointwise function into
// a monoid.
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

And we have a monoid! You could say a reducer is just the $Endo_{state}$ monoid lifted pointwise over actions. The monoid is precisely why using reducers is a nice way to decompose and reason about state changes in your application: Breaking down problems into pieces makes them more manageable, and the identity and associativity of the monoid means gluing them back together is easy. In fact, with our monoid instance on the manipulated reducer the $\epsilon$ and $\oplus$ give us a Redux-like library for free.

## Conclusion

Endofunctions are monoids, pointwise monoidal operations are monoids, and combining these two function-monoids give us reducers! The monoidal formulation of reducers obsoletes a need for a library to provide us a way to combine reducers and give us motivation for why reducers are such a nice way to manage changes to a larger application state.

## Bonus: Stick it in a Writer Monad

Reducers show up in two separate places in the comonadic UI framework implementation that I used in [barbq](/posts/introducing-barbq). In comonadic UI components, one of the kinds of reducers is located inside a [writer monad](/posts/ocaml-writer). Most of the time a component won't need to react to any actions, and if this is the case, components are unencumbered by boilerplate specifying a "dummy" reducer. The writer monad just takes `empty` for us. When we need to react to actions here, we can `tell` our component how to react to each one. We're able to get this nice API for free precisely because reducers are monoids.

[^1]: *Endo* means precisely that the domain and range (of a function) are the same.
[^2]: To reify is to make the abstract concrete, in this case, it's referring to making a "change" a value we can manipulate instead of just an operation we perform in our programs.
[^3]: A change that doesn't change anything
[^4]: The subscript $_A$ here is noting that there is a monoid instance for all choices of $A$.
[^5]: Moreover, operations lifted pointwise over any algebraic structure are also members of the same algebraic structure (so this is also true for semigroups, and other structures like rings, and semilattices too).
